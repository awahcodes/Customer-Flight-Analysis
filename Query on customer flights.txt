1. What is the total amount of tickets sold if we have low tickets as less than 20,000USD, mid range tick between 20,000 and 150000USD and the high range tickets as above 150,000USD

SELECT
CASE
WHEN total_amount < 20000 THEN 'Low Price'
WHEN total_amount BETWEEN 20000 and 150000 THEN 'Mid price'
ELSE 'Higher Price'
END  ticket_range,  COUNT(*) as Num_of_tickets
from bookings
WHERE total_amount IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ticket_range

2. How many flights departed each season.  

Winter: Dec, Jan, Feb
Spring: Mar, Apr, May
Summer: Jun, Jul, Aug
Fall: Sept, Oct, Nov

SELECT COUNT(*) as Num_of_flights,
CASE 
WHEN EXTRACT(month from scheduled_departure) IN (12,1,2) THEN 'Winter'
WHEN EXTRACT(month from scheduled_departure) IN (3,4,5) THEN 'Spring'
WHEN EXTRACT(month from scheduled_departure) IN (6,7,8) THEN 'Summer'
WHEN EXTRACT(month from scheduled_departure) IN (9,10,11) THEN 'Fall'
END as Travel_Season
FROM flights
GROUP BY Travel_Season 

3. Which category of tickets did customers by the most.

SELECT s.fare_conditions as category
,COUNT(s.seat_no) as num_of_tickets
FROM boarding_passes as b
INNER JOIN seats as s
USING(seat_no)
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY num_of_tickets DESC
LIMIT 1

4. How many tickets have been booked but with no boarding pass

SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM boarding_passes as b
FULL OUTER JOIN tickets as t
USING(ticket_no)
WHERE b.ticket_no IS NULL

5. Which aircraft have never been used for flight

SELECT
*
FROM aircrafts_data as a
LEFT JOIN flights as f 
USING(aircraft_code)
WHERE f.flight_id is NULL


6. What is the average amount for each seat on all flights

SELECT seat_no, ROUND(AVG(amount),2) as average_amt
FROM boarding_passes as b
LEFT JOIN ticket_flights as t
ON b.ticket_no = t.ticket_no
AND b.flight_id = t.flight_id
GROUP BY seat_no
ORDER BY  average_amt DESC

7. Write a query the running total of how late the flights are (difference btw actual_arrival and scheduled_arriva) ordered by flight_id including the departure_aiport

SELECT 
flight_id, actual_arrival - scheduled_arrival,
SUM(actual_arrival - scheduled_arrival ) OVER(PARTITION BY departure_airport ORDER BY flight_id)
FROM flights
